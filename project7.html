			 <h4>Team and Duration</h4>
			 <p> This project for the Region of Waterloo was done in a team of seven second year UX students. We collaborated through bi-weekly meetings as well as discussing in a group chat. During the bi-weekly meeting, we divided up tasks for that week, as well as examining next steps. My role in this project included conducting the card sort and tree test using Optimal Workshop, as well as, going to waterloo to help with the usability testing. I also played a key role in writing the final report. The timeline for this project was seven weeks. </p>
			 <h5>Team</h5>

			  <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
				 <p> The Region of Waterloo has been working over the past few years to increase the number of services available online. Their goals was to eliminate as many PDF forms as possible by transforming those into well designed online services. The vision of the Region was to improve the digital service journey. In the end we created a problem reporting tool.</p>
				
				<p>We created the following how might we statement based on the information given:</p>
				<blockquote> How might we allow the residents of Waterloo to be able to report a problem they experienced with the region and stay informed on the status of their inquiries.</blockquote>
				
				<p>For this project, followed the four steps, inspiration, ideation, iteration and implementation.  </p>

											  <h2>Inspiration </h2>
											  <p>We got inspiration through the data provided by the Region of Waterloo as well as conducting a competitive analysis and user research. Many different aspects of the data was looked at, including but not limited to, the bounce rate off the website, where the bounces were happening and the number of calls the call centre received per month. After gathering data from what was provided to us, we also ran a test of the current website with a small group of people to analyze the functionality of the website. Other region sites were also looked at to further generate inspiration.</p>

											   <h2>Ideation </h2>
											  <p>Once inspiration was drawn, the ideation stage began. At this stage, we narrowed our focus to reporting a problem and began to generate ideas for the solution. We started brainstorming and sketching out wireframes to further prototype. Sketches were made to generate ideas for what features we wanted in the final solution. After ideas were created, we moved on to creating a storyboard to map out the user experience through this reporting tool. We combine the storyboard into our the low fidelity prototype. </p>

												 <u>Sketches</u> <br>
											<ul><li>Taking about 10 minutes, we each individually sketched ideas for the prototype to brainstorm ideas.</li>
												<li>We placed all the sketches on one table and voted on the design that incorporated our ideas the best.</li>
												<li>Discussed what features made the winning sketches more appealing. </li>
												<li>After discussion, we decided that a map, tracking number, pictures, optional login, and an emotive submitted page will be included and tested to be determined if it will be in the final solution</li></ul>

											<br> <br> <u>Storyboard/Low Fidelity Prototype</u>
											 <ul> <li>A low fidelity prototype was created on the whiteboard. The prototype was then transferred to Google Slides. </li>
												<li>Combined the methodology of storyboarding into our low fidelity prototype as we felt that having a scenario for our prototype would help us keep in mind the user.</li><li> We decided on the opening scene of hitting a pothole, and then created the wireframes of the prototype based off the sketches done in the heat map.</li></ul>

											   <h2>Iteration</h2>
											  <p>The goal of this stage was to improve our solution according to user tests.  First, we conducted a card sort and tree test to refine our terms and categories. Later on, we also conducted a focus group to test our high fidelity prototype. The feedback received allowed us to refine our prototype. </p>

									 <p><u>Card Sorting/Tree Testing </u> <br>
										<ul><li>In the card sort, participants were given topics and categories. They were tasked to sort the topics into categories. </li>
										<li>We found a few ambiguous terms such as ‘staff member’ “hydro’ and ‘landfill’. </li>
										<li>After the card sort, we placed the sub-categories into categories and tested the categories in a tree test. In this test, we found that the location of the category ‘graffiti’ should be moved.</li> </ul></p>
									 
									 <p> <u>High Fidelity Prototype </u> <br>
									 Adobe XD was used to create a high fidelity interactive prototype of our “Report a Problem Tool”. This was created based off our low fidelity prototype, with slight alterations based on the findings of our card sort and tree tests. </p>

									 <br> <u>Testing</u> <br>
									 The Adobe XD prototype was tested during two focus groups set up with the Region of Waterloo. Six participants were asked to complete 3 sample tasks we had outlined for them; we encouraged participants to use a ‘think out loud protocol’ (to speak their thoughts while testing out the prototype). 
									 Detailed feedback was given from the focus group testing. These feedback points include: 
									 <ul>
									 <li>The search bar function was not often used </li>
									 <li>The ambulance/paramedic subcategories of “The care I received” and “The way I was treated” are similar and often confused </li>
									 <li>File size/type specifications for document/picture upload should be added </li>
									 <li>Information/help button for how to fill out the form correctly or what’s expected of certain fields should be added</li>
									 <li>Map feature perceived well </li>
									 <li>Location services for users who want to see where they are on the map should be added </li>
									 <li>Add buildings/institution names as locations landmarks</li>
									 <li>Request vs. report was confusing </li>
									 <li>The different tabs to the left of the map are confusing/misunderstood</li>
									 <li>The differences between having an account and not having one are not clear </li>
									 <li>Add where exactly the claim is going (i.e claims department)</li>
									 <li>Add an approximate time frame for when their issue will be resolved</li>
									 <li>Feedback survey of ‘how we did’ after issue is resolved</li>
									 </ul> </div>

											   <h2>Implementation</h2>
											  <p>Lastly, after completing all the changes, the problem reporting tool is finally ready to be implemented. A final prototype was created with all the adjusted changes that were suggested. The tool is now ready to be coded in full and embedded into the Region of Waterloo website under the ‘I want to’ bar.</p>
